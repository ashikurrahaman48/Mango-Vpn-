## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This helps us generate automated changelogs and makes the commit history easier to read.

Your commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Common types:**
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

Example: `fix: Correctly handle disconnection errors in the client`

## Coding Style

- **TypeScript**: We use TypeScript for type safety. Please include types for all new code.
- **Linting**: We use a linter to maintain a consistent code style. Please ensure your code passes the linting checks.
- **Comments**: Write comments for complex logic or parts of the code that may be hard to understand.

Thank you again for your interest in contributing!
